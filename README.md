# Jest RPG
## Description
Using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to help write code that's maintainable and follows best practices, we create an RPG with characters, enemies, and a game object. The user will have the choice to attack or use a potion to increase one of their three stats: strength, agility, and health.
