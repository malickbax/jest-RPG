# Jest RPG
## Description
Using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to help write code that's maintainable and follows best practices, we create an RPG with characters, enemies, and a game object. The user will have the choice to attack or use a potion to increase one of their three stats: strength, agility, and health.

## Usage
- Please clone this repository and install the required packages: Inquirer and Jest. Once installed, run the app.js in CLI to start the application. As the application runs, the user will have the choice to attack or use a potion to increase one of their three stats: strength, agility, and health.

## Tests
- All test codes are located under the `__tests__` folder.
